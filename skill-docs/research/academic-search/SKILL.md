# Academic Search
## When to Use
Use these tools instead of web search for any academic or literature-related query.
## Common Workflows
- **Find Papers**: Use `search_works` (OpenAlex) or `search_papers` (Semantic Scholar) with a query and publication year.
- **Research an Author**: Use `search_authors` to find an author's ID, then use `retrieve_author_works` to get their publications.
- **Medical Research**: Use `search_pubmed` for clinical or biomedical topics.
